                <p>
                    The Canine Skin Detection system is a cutting-edge tool designed to assist pet owners and veterinarians in identifying common skin conditions in dogs. Utilizing advanced artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms, our system analyzes photos and videos of dogs to detect potential skin issues with high accuracy.
